# **INTRODUCTION** 
Breast cancer stands as a formidable public health challenge in Kenya, characterized by alarmingly high mortality rates largely attributed to late-stage detection. The country's healthcare system grapples with limited resources, including a shortage of skilled pathologists and a dearth of advanced diagnostic technologies. Consequently, the prevailing manual diagnostic methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and often lead to delayed or inaccurate diagnoses. This project aims to address these critical issues by developing and implementing a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying breast cancer types from histopathological images.


# **BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**
The overarching goal of this project is to address the critical issue of breast cancer in Kenya, characterized by high mortality rates due to late-stage detection and limited access to quality healthcare. By developing a deep machine learning-based solution, this aims to enhance early diagnosis, improve diagnostic efficiency, and expand access to accurate breast cancer screening services. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality rates and improve the overall quality of life for Kenyan women.

# **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
Breast cancer poses a significant public health challenge, characterized by high mortality rates primarily due to late-stage detection. The country's healthcare system faces numerous obstacles in addressing this crisis, including limited access to specialized healthcare, a shortage of skilled pathologists, and a lack of advanced diagnostic technologies. Consequently, the current manual diagnostic process is time-consuming, error-prone, and often leads to delayed or inaccurate diagnoses. This delay in identifying and treating breast cancer has severe implications for patient outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality rates. To mitigate these challenges and improve breast cancer care in Kenya, there is a critical need for innovative solutions that can enhance early detection, improve diagnostic accuracy, and increase accessibility to quality care.

# **OBJECTIVES**
1. Develop a robust image classification model: Create an accurate and efficient machine learning model capable of distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tissue based on histopathological images.
2. Improve diagnostic efficiency: Accelerate the diagnostic process by automating image analysis tasks, reducing the workload on pathologists, and enabling faster patient treatment.
3. Enhance patient outcomes: Contribute to early detection of breast cancer, leading to improved treatment options and increased survival rates.

**Goals**

* Analyze existing data on breast cancer in Kenya.
* Develop a machine learning model for classifying histopathological images.
* Evaluate the model's performance and potential impact.
* Explore integration strategies for the model into Kenya's healthcare system.

# **METRICS OF SUCCESS**
1. Accuracy: As a measure of the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances. It reflects the model's ability to classify data points accurately, with higher accuracy indicating better performance in distinguishing between different classes.

t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving the underlying structure of the data. 
Each point in the plot represents an image, and its position is determined by its calculated t-SNE components. Green points represent benign images, and red points represent malignant images. the t-SNE algorithm has effectively preserved the underlying structure of the data. indicating that the image features associated with these two classes are different.

## Data Preprocessing
1. Resizing images to a consistent dimension is essential for feeding them into neural networks, which require fixed input sizes.
2. Normalization & Scaling by adjusting the pixel values of images to a common scale.
3. Data Augmentation artificially increase the size of the training dataset by creating variations of existing images.
4. Batching the dataset into smaller subsets that are processed together during training.


### Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing tested to validate assumptions about the dataset and draw inferences. It assesed the performance of different models or algorithms (comparing accuracy between a baseline model and a new model).It validated assumptions about the distribution of pixel values or class labels, ensuring that the data met the necessary conditions for modeling techniques.

 Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis assessed the strength and direction of relationships between variables, feature selection and modeling strategies.
Identified relationships between different features (e.g. pixel intensity values, color channels) and the target variable ( class labels), guiding the selection of relevant features for the model.


# MODELING

### Model Architecture

* **CNN Model**: A basic convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture consisting of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
* **ResNet Model**: A pre-trained ResNet50 model used as the backbone, followed by global average pooling and dense layers for classification.

### Model Training

Both models were trained using a combination of training and validation datasets. We used optimization algorithms to minimize the loss function and update model parameters. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were tuned for optimal performance.

**Model Evaluation**
------------------

* **Accuracy**: Overall proportion of correct predictions.
* **Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that were correct.
* **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual positive cases correctly identified.
* **Specificity**: Proportion of actual negative cases correctly identified (primarily for ResNet model).
* **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
* **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions.
* {: width="200" height="150"}
* **ROC Curve**: Visual representation of the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify malignant and benign breast cancer samples. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices were created to compare the predicted labels against the actual labels.

**Findings and Results Interpretation**
------------------------------------

## CNN Model

The CNN model achieved reasonable accuracy, but exhibited signs of overfitting, as evidenced by the gap between training and validation accuracy.

The low number of false negatives suggests that the model is effective in detecting malignant cases, which is crucial for early diagnosis.
While the number of false positives is relatively low.

### ResNet Model

The ResNet model demonstrated superior performance, with higher accuracy, precision, and recall. The confusion matrix revealed a lower false positive rate for the ResNet model. The ROC curve indicated a strong ability to discriminate between benign and malignant cases.
